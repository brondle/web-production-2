### Reading
- [Web Development With Node & Express](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ip-1kA9k3VzpIOL0gczB09umHAgw_r5a/view?usp=sharing) - Revisit Ch.7, p.81-83 (client-side templates), read Ch. 8, Form Handling (it’s still a useful reference, but some of the code in this book is a bit out of date, so when in doubt, stick with the code in the assignment or starter code over copying code directly from the book).

### If you want to get ahead on databases/making a CRUD app:
- ~~We’ll be working with [turbo360](https://www.turbo360.co/) when we get back since it’s an easy way to get your database hosted online. Create an account with them and check out their [docs](https://docs.turbo360.co/) and [tutorials](https://www.turbo360.co/tutorials) - part 6 of this [Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/portfolio-website-with-node-js-express/learn/lecture/16276404#overview) is helpful for setting up a database, although we won’t be using their routing setup in class.~~ - they went out of business :(

### Assignment

### Homework:

You’ve got two weeks, so you’ve got two things to do:

1. [Email me](mailto:bb3257@hunter.cuny.edu) a ~300 word [final](final.md) proposal. This should contain an outline of what you’re envisioning:
- What you want to build
- What tools you’ll use
- How you’ll integrate a node.js server
- What different pages & functionality your final will have.

2. Assignment: 

### Option 1: Your Very Own World Of Text/CRUD App Prototype
- Using the [starter code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CkitMaBhCfktgM0kX14DjhQLDl9aANH3/view?usp=sharing), create your own world of text/message board/social network/To Do list, collaborative poetry app, whatever you’d like it to be!
- Modify the styling and code/templates to reflect what you’d like your project to be - if it’s a social network or message board, give it a name. If it’s a giant collaborative poem, change the title and form HTML to reflect that!
- Add at least one new attribute to the form in `messages.handlebars`, make sure it gets added to the `messages` object in app.js, and display it in the handlebars template in `messages.handlebars`.
-  Try adding a new element with an AJAX function that goes to a `put` route in `app.js` to modify an object, like a button to add likes to an object or an input to add comments - check the [tutorial code](), specifically `edit-messages` and `app.put(‘messages’)` in line 101 of `app.js` if you’re having issues.

### Option 2: Bot Prototype
**Important: if you want to make a Twitter bot, you’ll need to [apply for API access](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/getting-access-to-the-twitter-api) pretty much ASAP - you’ll have to go back and forth with them over email for a day or two to get your key, just tell them your project is creative/artistic/educational and try and be specific about what you’re building, e.g. “I’m building a generative text bot with Node.js for a course at Hunter College”**
- You can make a Twitter bot following the [tutorial code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dKj2iUEVaWEosJuFIr921_gaX9T8VE_y/view?usp=sharing) from class, or try your hand at making a [Discord Bot](https://www.sitepoint.com/discord-bot-node-js/), a texting bot with [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2018/03/sms-bot-node-texteverything.html), or a bot for another platform of your preference.
- If you can’t get developer access and still want to try, you can use the .env file for the class Twitter account from the starter code.
- If you make a Twitter bot, or a bot that uses an API key, you’ll need to set your .env variables **in heroku*** for it to work, and set it up as a “worker” instead of a web app - more instructions on that [here](https://medium.com/nerd-for-tech/create-twitter-bot-using-nodejs-and-deploy-on-heroku-dd6ec31534f4) and [here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/config-vars)
- If you follow the Twitter bot starter code, make it your own - try customizing what it generates, or tweeting from another API - you can check this week’s inspiration for more things to try.
- If you make a Twitter bot, for your “hosted online” send a link to the bot’s account - if you’re trying a different service, send a screenshot or blog post explaining what it does
- If you’re having trouble deploying your bot to Heroku, or just getting it to work, don’t worry too much about it - this is meant to be a prototype, and they don’t always work!
