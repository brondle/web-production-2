## Playing With Twitter Bots
In the starter code, `cd` into `exercise-2`.

This default code uses a [markov chain]*(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain)  and the Rita.js package (https://rednoise.org/rita/) to generate random text from a string of words we feed it
Run `npm install` and `node app.js` to get it going in localhost and play around with generating sandwiches for a bit.
- Try making your own corpus variable to train the bot on - right now, it generates random sandwiches. I’ve included some sample code for using [corpora](https://github.com/dariusk/corpora) and [corpora-project](https://www.npmjs.com/package/corpora-project), if you want to try those out, but you can also try just writing your own, or copying and pasting text to put into the corpus variable. The markov chain is trained on the text inside that variable and generates random text from it. Generally, the more text you use the better.
- Add your name to the end of the tweet string in server.js
- Play around with generating text with the corpus you’ve created on the frontend, and if you get anything really good, tweet it out to the account!
