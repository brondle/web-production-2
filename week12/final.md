## Introducing the Final

### Option 1 - Multi-Page Website
**Create a multi-page interactive website that uses Node.js on the server-side and allows the user to interact with it on the front-end. You’ll make a 5-10 minute presentation of your project to the class on December 16. This will be 25% of your grade for the semester!**
- The website should have at least 5 pages
- The website should use front-end JavaScript to make it interactive
- Other than that, it’s up to you! Feel free to build off a previous assignment or your midterm, as well.
- Some ideas: 
    - If you’re less comfortable with JavaScript, make a portfolio site or an informational site about a topic you care about. 
    - If you’re more comfortable, try making your own CRUD app: a to-do app, or a clone of a social media site, or something else that’s a good fit for more advanced server-side work.

### Option 2: Roll Your Own
- The only hard and fast requirement here is that your project run on a node.js server.
- Want to make a bot,  or a game, or some other personal project you’ve been wanting to work on? Feel free. 
- Just make sure it’s relatively creative and complex: as in the midterm, making a Twitter bot that just posts from the Kanye API doesn’t show much creativity or complexity. Making a discord bot for a community you’re on that does useful things, or making a Twitter bot that interacts with your own custom code or an external API to do something creative, show more of that.

#### Grading Rubric:

- 50% fit and finish: does it look good? Does it do what you set out to do? Does it meet the specs laid out in the midterm assignment? 
- 35% presentation: you’ll give a 5-10 minute presentation that
  - Shows and explains the final work
  - Walks us through your code and development process 
  - Walks us through the problems you ran into and how you solved (or didn’t solve) them. Bugs are to be expected! Tell us what went wrong!
- 15% creativity of concept/implementation: is it a creative concept or implementation? This can mean doing something creative conceptually, doing something interesting or advanced with your code/CSS/HTML, or making animations/graphics with jQuery/p5/CSS. This also includes using advanced programming techniques on the front-end and the server-side: turning lines you keep repeating into functions, using loops and variables to make your code more readable and efficient, using a database or advanced server functions, or implementing interesting NPM packages.

#### If You’re Worried

- You’ve got a month!
- Bugs are to be expected - we’ll even have a debugging session after the midterm presentation. If you just can’t get something to work, you’re not going to fail.
- Lean into your strengths, and document your process: take screenshots, make slides, add comments documenting what you tried. I’d rather see a project that doesn’t work where you clearly put it in effort than one that does but is low-effort.
