### Assignment
You have two options this week, either:
#### Option 1 - Media Player
Create your own iteration on the media player app.
- Change the title using JavaScript
- Style at least two elements on the page using JavaScript
- Add at least one button or input to the UI that does something to the page or the media player with a JavaScript function - change its size, styling, speed, add an element - the crazier the better! (there’s an example of this with the “wacky mode” input)
- Add at least two more options to the switch statement to pick videos - there are more videos in the videos folder, but you can also download your own (just make sure to keep them short, GitHub gets mad about upload limits) 
- If you’re comfortable with the command line, [youtube-dl](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/index.html) is a great tool for downloading videos, my usual command is `youtube-dl '{youtube link here}' -f 'bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/best[ext=mp4]/best'`

#### Option 2 - Fortune Teller

Create your own iteration on the fortune teller app.

- Change the title using JavaScript
- Style at least two elements on the page using JavaScript - no CSS this week!
- You can also do this by adding styling in an if or switch statement, like case 5 setting a red background color
- Add a new input (it can be a select, text input, number, or anything else) and use its value in an if/else, switch statement, or function to add to the fortune
- Add at least two more options to the switch statement (You’ll need to add more options to the `<select>` tag!)

## Either Option

- In your web production 2 folder, create a folder called `week4`
- Put your finished code in the `week4` folder and commit and push to GitHub
- Check and make sure it uploaded to your GitHub page - it should be at {your github username}.github.io/week4/
- Submit the link [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJ_hzjToD08UX5Py2QP4t8VhiKaIAHZNn6dQVUQbSerfHgrA/viewform?usp=sf_link)
