### Assignment

Start work on your final, if you haven’t already, or if you have, continue building on top of it. You don’t need to have a complete project, or even a working one for next week - just try to build out the basic functionalities you’ll need for your project. If you’re running into trouble, make a note of it or add comments, and we’ll talk about it one-on-one in the next class. Submit your work in progress to the [Homework Form](https://forms.gle/DMcG64NvRdbSjsq57).
