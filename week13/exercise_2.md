## Wireframing Exercise

In your text editor of choice, answer the following questions. Be prepared to discuss them once you’re done.

1. What’s a one-sentence elevator pitch for your project? (e.g. I’m making a to-do app for dogs)

2. What tools or NPM packages do you plan to use?

3. What structure will your app.js take, e.g. what `put`, `post`, `get` and `delete` routes will it have? What will each one do?

4. If your project has a front-end (bots excluded), what Handlebars templates or partials will it need?

5. What front-end work will you need to do? How will you incorporate JavaScript & CSS to make it interactive? What will each page from the previous question need?


6. If you want to use your server to store JavaScript data or interact with a database, what will you need to store, and what attributes will objects you’re storing have? How will you change or update them? Try making a mock MongoDB schema for your project if you think you’ll want to use a database.

7. What questions are still unanswered about how you’ll complete your project? What do you think your biggest issues completing it will be?
