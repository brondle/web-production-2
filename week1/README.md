## Setting Up Git And Your Home Directory

### Making The Home Directory

Welcome! Let’s get started by setting up the directory where your work is going to live.
For a quick refresher, the terminal is basically a direct interface to your computer - text-based, rather than the graphical interfaces (like Finder on Mac or File Browser on Windows) that most people use. The terminal is a beautiful thing and learning to use it well will make you an extremely powerful programmer.

Some basic commands to get used to:

`cd`: change directory - enter a folder
`mkdir {directory name}`: make a new folder
`touch {file name}`: make a new file
`ls`: list all files in the current folder

Open the terminal and type `cd Documents`. If you have a preferred folder for classwork, go ahead and `cd` into it for the next step.

Now let’s make a directory for this class: `mkdir web-production-2``

Cd into that folder: `cd web-production-2`

Great! You’ve created the folder where all your work for this course will live.

Let’s go back to the terminal and get set up for today’s exercises:

`mkdir week-1-exercises`
`cd week-1-exercises`
`touch script.js`
`touch style.css`
`touch index.html`
`mkdir img`
