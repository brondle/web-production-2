  ## Assignment 1: Course Homepage
  - Using the template from class, make a homepage for yourself in this course. 
  - You can include information about yourself, your art practice, or your goals for the course (or whatever else you'd like it to be) - just make it your own content, instead of the template.
  - Requirements:
	- Add your own custom CSS styling (it doesn’t have to be complicated)
  - Interact with at least one element on the page using an external script - change the CSS styling, its internal text, move it around the page
	- Include at least one image or video
  - Upload the page to GitHub (don’t forget to commit and push!) and upload the link [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tXTbImANfXcBY0KVHcC72LyNM-9ipEOtpwGOsX7Nk3U/edit?usp=sharing) by Wednesday, August 1 at 8pm.
