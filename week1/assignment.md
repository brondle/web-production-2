  ## Assignment 1: Course Homepage
  - Using the template we created, make a homepage for this class. 
  - You can include information about yourself, your art practice, or your goals for the course (or whatever else you'd like it to be) - just make it your own content, instead of what I showed you in class.
  - Requirements:
	- Add your own custom CSS styling (it doesn’t have to be complicated)
	- Interact with at least one element on the page using JavaScript - change the CSS styling, its internal text, move it around the page
	- Include at least one image or video
  - Upload the page to GitHub (don’t forget to commit and push!) and upload the link [here] by Wednesday, August 1 at 8pm. (https://forms.gle/U4yRr9VrAHXb1Mgu5)
