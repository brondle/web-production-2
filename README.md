    - Configuring and modifying node.js servers and MongoDB, databases for the web.
    - Pairing server-side functions and backend data structures with compelling visual interfaces made with CSS, AJAX, and JavaScript
    - Students should be able to recognize and use the features listed above in JavaScript, MongoDB, and JSON.

## Required Reading

1) Class and lecture participation (20% of grade). By enrolling in this course and entering the classroom, each student
makes the tacit commitment to participate in the class. Active class participation involves more
than mere physical presence. Students are expected to be actively involved in the class. They
should take the initiative in discussion and projects, ask relevant questions, and contribute to
the over-all learning environment of the class.

2) Technical exercises/homework (30%)

3) Midterm assignment (25%)

4) Final assignment (25%)

## A Note on Coding

Copying and pasting, especially from StackOverflow, is an integral part of any programmer's life. You are welcome to use code you find in the web (and code we write in class) as part of your own work, though please make sure to thank the source in a code comment. That said, the code should be made your own, as part of a project you write. An assignment that is directly copy and pasted will result in failing that assignment.  

I would always prefer you send me broken code than somebody else's code. Bugs are a natural part of the programming process, and you will not be penalized for code that doesn't work as long as you made a good faith effort to resolve the problem. If you're stuck on a particularly tricky bug, you can talk to me during office hours or reach out to me over e-mail.
