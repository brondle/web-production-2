### Assignment 3

- [Starter Code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wXe27STsQUWOGwpawArC-CCaelwgfgEl/view?usp=sharing)
- Make your own iteration on one of the p5 sketches from class: self-portrait, abstract art. You’re welcome to use the assignment starter code or the code from class as a jumping off point, but you should add at least 3 new shapes or lines and show evidence of exploring with [color](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_names.asp), position, etc.
- Or roll your own drawing! If you’re a more experienced JavaScript programmer, consider adding animation or movement.
- If you decided to work in the p5 editor, don’t forget to hit `File > Download`, and add a `<link rel=”stylesheet” href=”styles.css”`> to your “index.html” for the next step.
- In the `index.html` file for your p5 sketch, add an HTML element with at least one CSS animation or transition from class (other than the one in the starter code).
- Or feel free to use a JavaScript transition instead.
- In your web production 2 folder, create a folder called `week3`
- Put your finished code in the `week3` folder and commit and push to GitHub
- Check and make sure it uploaded to your GitHub page - it should be at {your github username}.github.io/week3/
