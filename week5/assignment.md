## Assignment - [Starter Code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ogj5CTEg5Ha4EEQuG7NaijXLV35h9dck/view?usp=sharing)

### Option 1: Object Story (assignment_story in the [starter code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ogj5CTEg5Ha4EEQuG7NaijXLV35h9dck/view?usp=sharing))
Using the starter code, create your own array of at least 5 objects each and use it to write a short story.
- (Or whatever you’d like - you could write a series of recipes, or a poem, or a list of complaints, or mad libs)
- Each object should have least **four** key/value pairs, like - `[{noun: ‘dog’, adjective: ‘brown’, verb: ‘ran’, adverb: ‘quickly’}]` - but come up with your own, don’t just use mine!
- Use a for loop over the array to add your keys and values to the container.
- You can use the included `showElements()` and `createDiv()` functions to add them or come up with your own way (if you use `createDiv()`, add more to the sentence)
- Update the HTML and `addItems()` functions for your extra keys so you can add to the array
- Feel free to add your own CSS styles
- Bonus points: use an array as a key value and iterate over that; use the getRandomItem() function to make it randomized; use a querySelector() to add an onclick function or change the HTML


### Option 2: Image Collage (assignment_img in the [starter code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ogj5CTEg5Ha4EEQuG7NaijXLV35h9dck/view?usp=sharing))
Create an image collage using an array of objects.
- Using the starter code, create your own array of at least 5 objects with image sources and attributes
- In the `addImage()` function, add a for loop that adds them to the page using the `createDiv()` function
- They’re already absolutely positioned, so set position attributes for them in the object keys and apply them in the `createDiv()` function - like the “top” and “left” in the starter code
- Add at least one key/value pair to each object that styles either the `<div>` or the `<img>` in the `createDiv()` function (like the width and height or top and left in the starter code)
- You can also add captions or other elements from your object - go wild!
- Feel free to add your own CSS styles as well
- Bonus points: use a querySelector to add an onclick function to them; add a button that changes their HTML or order

<img src='img/collage.png' width='800px' >
(One possible outcome from your collage)

## Either Option

- In your web production 2 folder, create a folder called `week5`
- Put your finished code in the `week5` folder and commit and push to GitHub
- Check and make sure it uploaded to your GitHub page - it should be at {your github username}.github.io/week5/
- Submit the link [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJ_hzjToD08UX5Py2QP4t8VhiKaIAHZNn6dQVUQbSerfHgrA/viewform?usp=sf_link)
