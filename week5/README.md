# Class 5: JavaScript Review 3.0

- [Notes for today](notes.md)

## Setup

Download and open the [starter code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WcsCXX1DsHpPO5XiFghSh5Jc46QRgE0f/view?usp=sharing) in the browser and Atom. Don’t forget to open the console!

## Part 1: Arrays And Loops
- Tutorial - open the arrays and loops folder and follow along in index.html and script.js

#### Exercise (Pick One)
##### Text
In the `exercise` folder, either create a simple array of things you’re interested in and try accessing items by index, displaying them on the page in a for loop in the `addArray() function`, reversing them, changing their styles - anything else you’d like to try. You can try adding them using the createLi function included or roll your own. Once you’ve added them in a for loop, try using the `addItems()` function to add new ones

##### Images:
In the `exercise_img` folder, create an array of image sources - you can get links in google image search by left clicking an image and hitting “copy image link”. 
- Try adding them to the page in a for loop in the `addImages()` function I’ve included.
- Try adding a button that reverses them, or displays a single image
- Try adding new image sources using the input button

## Part 2 - Objects
- Tutorial: follow along in script.js and index.html in the “objects” folder
- Exercise/assignment: pick one of the options from the assignment below and start on it - due Wednesday, October 6 at 8pm.

## Assignment - [Starter Code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ogj5CTEg5Ha4EEQuG7NaijXLV35h9dck/view?usp=sharing)

### Option 1: Object Story (assignment_story in the [starter code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ogj5CTEg5Ha4EEQuG7NaijXLV35h9dck/view?usp=sharing))
Using the starter code, create your own array of at least 5 objects each and use it to write a short story.
- (Or whatever you’d like - you could write a series of recipes, or a poem, or a list of complaints, or mad libs)
- Each object should have least **four** key/value pairs, like - `[{noun: ‘dog’, adjective: ‘brown’, verb: ‘ran’, adverb: ‘quickly’}]` - but come up with your own, don’t just use mine!
- Use a for loop over the array to add your keys and values to the container.
- You can use the included `showElements()` and `createDiv()` functions to add them or come up with your own way (if you use `createDiv()`, add more to the sentence)
- Update the HTML and `addItems()` functions for your extra keys so you can add to the array
- Feel free to add your own CSS styles
- Bonus points: use an array as a key value and iterate over that; use the getRandomItem() function to make it randomized; use a querySelector() to add an onclick function or change the HTML

### Option 2: Image Collage (assignment_img in the [starter code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ogj5CTEg5Ha4EEQuG7NaijXLV35h9dck/view?usp=sharing))
Create an image collage using an array of objects.
- Using the starter code, create your own array of at least 5 objects with image sources and attributes
- In the `addImage()` function, add a for loop that adds them to the page using the `createDiv()` function
- They’re already absolutely positioned, so set position attributes for them in the object keys and apply them in the `createDiv()` function - like the “top” and “left” in the starter code
- Add at least one key/value pair to each object that styles either the <div> or the <img> in the `createDiv()` function (like the width and height or top and left in the starter code)
- You can also add captions or other elements from your object - go wild!
- Feel free to add your own CSS styles as well
- Bonus points: use a querySelector to add an onclick function to them; add a button that changes their HTML or order

<img src='img/collage.png' width='800px' >
(One possible outcome from your collage)

## Either Option

- In your web production 2 folder, create a folder called `week5`
- Put your finished code in the `week5` folder and commit and push to GitHub
- Check and make sure it uploaded to your GitHub page - it should be at {your github username}.github.io/week5/
- Submit the link [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJ_hzjToD08UX5Py2QP4t8VhiKaIAHZNn6dQVUQbSerfHgrA/viewform?usp=sf_link)
