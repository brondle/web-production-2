## Midterm Presentations

- Presentation (5-10 minutes)
- Feedback (5 minutes)


### Presentation
Your presentation should:
- Show and explain the final work
- Walk us through your code and development process, inspiration, and anything else relevant to your project
- Walk us through the problems you ran into and how you solved (or didn’t solve) them. Bugs are to be expected! Tell us what went wrong!

### Giving Feedback

Feedback should be more than “I liked it” or “it was bad.” Give examples, think about what worked and what didn’t. Some feedback prompts:

- What did you like/what are you impressed by and why?
- What would you like to see them build on or add?
- Do you have any inspiration or ideas for them to consider?
- What questions do you have? e.g. How does this part work?
- If something didn’t work for you, or you didn’t like it - what issues do you have? What suggestions would you make to improve it?
