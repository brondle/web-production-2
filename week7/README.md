## Week 7: Midterm Discussion, Advanced AJAX & jQuery


## If you’re having issues with jQuery & GitHub

Make sure your jQuery script in your HTML is using https, like so:

`<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.2.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
`
GitHub requires HTTPS - if you’re curious why, more [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/why-is-http-not-secure/)


## Setup

[Starter Code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oPoBxyGZueCFyzK7bKvJupmdDP4uo8S4/view?usp=sharing) - download and open in Atom & the browser.


### Examples

jQuery Animations & AJAX:  
- [TV Maze Slider Zip File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wbr-3GtMXN3rZFdI8KGEmwuJzPLBs9Kd/view?usp=sharing) - a slider using jQuery animations, event handlers, and the [TVMaze API](https://www.tvmaze.com/api)
Multiple AJAX Requests:

- [Blackjack Game Zip File](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10q9ENZQJo0NhihMCBIoGk5J7cV4VD0Q0/view?usp=sharing) - a simple 2-player blackjack game using the [Deck of Cards API](https://deckofcardsapi.com/)

## 2: Advanced jQuery

This is all more advanced jQuery that you might want to (but don’t have to) use in the midterm.

1: In the setup, follow along in the `jquery` folder in Atom and the Browser

  - `keypress`: A demo of using jQuery’s keypress detection
  - `mousemove`: A demo of using jQuery’s built in mouse movement functions.
  - `animations`: A demo of jQuery’s different built-in animation functions and making your own custom animation.

2: Group [exercise](jquery_exercise.md)

- #### [Notes](advanced_jquery.md)


## 3. Advanced AJAX

Again, this is some more advanced AJAX that you don’t have to (or may not need to) use on the midterm, but is good to understand.

1. Follow along in the `ajax` folder in the starter code:
- `pokemon`: making requests to multiple endpoints with pokemon API

2. Group [exercise](ajax_exercise.md)

- #### [Notes](advanced_ajax.md): adding events to pre-written HTML, making multiple API requests, making your own HTML and adding events to it
- #### Examples (these are also in the examples folder in this GitHub):
  - [OpenLibrary](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SChwrZnDBBDAtp5F6m7FSBAqhwE6uD6G/view?usp=sharing) - making a search using the [OpenLibrary](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) search endpoint, then requesting a cover from the covers endpoint



### Next Week

Next week we’ll spend the first part of the class setting up your servers for the second half of the semester, and the second part of the class in a midterm work session/taking turns meeting with me one-on-one to discuss your midterm. Come prepared to discuss your progress and any issues you’re having with the midterm with me.


### No homework this week - catch up on homework you’ve missed and work on your midterm.
