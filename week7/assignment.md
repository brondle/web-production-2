### Next Week

Next week we’ll spend the first part of the class setting up your servers for the second half of the semester, and the second part of the class in a group midterm work session/taking turns meeting with me one-on-one to discuss your midterm. Come prepared to discuss your progress and any issues you’re having with the midterm with me.


### No homework this week - catch up on homework you’ve missed and work on your midterm - remember, this is 25% of your grade!
