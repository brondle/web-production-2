#### jQuery

(There’s a lot of these, but they’re all pretty short and part of the [w3Schools jQuery tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp), which is a pretty useful reference)

## Homework - Quick Prototype

- This is the first step in the [midterm!](midterm.md)
- [Some APIs to choose from](apis.md)
- [Sample requests for most of them](AJAX_exercise.md)
- [Samples from class](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12P8bUZlKlimvJX0EN9iGEuezo31ROGV-/view?usp=sharing)
- Pick an API for your midterm - you’re welcome to use one of the APIs from the examples (except the Kanye API) or the list above, or research your own.
- Once you’ve picked an API, start getting familiar with it - read the docs, think about what you could build with it.
- If you’re not using one of the APIs from the examples, try making a call to the API with the [sample AJAX request](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1U-SWOjupG3vuycC2OOKLKnjlW32-Ff04/view?usp=sharing), log the data in the console, and display data from it on the page using JavaScript/jQuery (or p5, if you’re feeling adventurous - some resources for working with AJAX & JSON in p5 are listed above).
- If you use one of the APIs from the examples, display something else from that API call (e.g. in the Pokemon example, add the Pokemon’s type to the page) or add more inputs/styles/whatever else you’d like to do.
- If you’ve picked an API and are having trouble getting it to work, leave a comment with the error you’re having (or try a different API).
- ### **Separately**: Once you’ve done some research and played with API calls, [email me](mailto:bb3257@hunter.cuny.edu) a short (no more than 300 word) proposal for your midterm.
Include the API you’re planning to use, what your site will do, any challenges/issues you might face, and how you plan to get there. Come to class next week ready to discuss your proposal.


#### Submission

- In your web production 2 folder, create a folder called `week6`
- **IMPORTANT**: if you’re using an API with a key, delete it and put a placeholder - people love to steal API keys from GitHub. Send me your key separately in your email
- Put your quick prototype in the `week6` folder and commit and push to GitHub
- Check and make sure it uploaded to your GitHub page - it should be at {your github username}.github.io/week5/
- Submit the link [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJ_hzjToD08UX5Py2QP4t8VhiKaIAHZNn6dQVUQbSerfHgrA/viewform?usp=sf_link)
