## Reading
- If you’re getting stuck or confused, revisit [week 8](../week8/) - there are tons of resources there. 
- [Server Basics Notes](notes-basic.md)
- [Complex Server Notes](notes-server.md)
- [Web Development With Node & Express](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ip-1kA9k3VzpIOL0gczB09umHAgw_r5a/view?usp=sharing) - Ch. 3 (Saving Time With Express), Ch. 7 (Templating With Handlebars) - it’s still a useful reference, but some of the code in this book is a bit out of date, so when in doubt, stick with the code in the assignment or starter code over copying code directly from the book.

## Assignment

### Option 1: Prototype portfolio site

- Using the [assignment starter code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17iu29C0HHS05ZSJ_BelyLZ9SLEHM8RBx/view?usp=sharing), build a prototype of a portfolio site using Node and Handlebars - this is already set up for all the functionality, you just have to modify it to be about you!
- Modify the about and home pages to be about your own creative work, whether it’s in this class or in general.
- Add at least one partial to `views/partials` and display it on multiple pages (this could be an image of you, or a link you want to reuse across pages)
- In line 16 of app.js, modify the `ListOfWorks` to contain links, images, titles, and any other attributes you’d like to pass to a page that displays your portfolio. Add at least 3 objects to the array and least one new attribute to each object (like a description or a hashtag). This can just be your assignments for this class so far, or you can make it about any other projects you’d like to link to.
- Make sure to put any images in `public/img`.
- Display the objects and new attributes in either the `views/works` template in the `{{#each}}` loop, or on separate pages using the `views/work` template. (or feel free modify each page to do both!)
- In line 26, modify the `moreInfo` variable to display facts about yourself in the `about.handlebars` template.
- Feel free to add your own styles or frontend JavaScript in the `public/` folder, or build out the site more as you see fit!

### Option 2: Multipage Story

- Using the [assignment starter code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1089dew0OMGUwgSZvjq0X_yOzUfKIX80y/view?usp=sharing), build a multipage story using Node and Handlebars- this is already set up for all the functionality, you just have to modify it to be about you!
- Modify the `about` and `home` pages to be about your story.
- Add at least one partial to `views/partials` and display it on multiple pages (this could be an image of you, or a link you want to reuse across pages)
- Modify the `moreInfo` variable in line 29 of `app.js` to be about your story, and check that it displays in the about page.
- Using the `story` variable in line 38 of `app.js`, add at least four objects to your story and one new attribute to each object- like adding a “title” or more text to the story. Make sure to display the new attribute in the `page` template.
- Make sure to put any images in the `public/img` folder.
- Try and see if you can create a “previous page” variable in the page route (at line 40) and link to it in the page template.
- Feel free to add your own styles or frontend JavaScript in the `public/` folder, or build out the site more as you see fit!

### Submission

- It might be easiest to create a new GitHub repository for this assignment in Atom, or you can copy it over to your existing repo for server-side work. 
- Once you’ve committed and pushed it to GitHub, make sure to push it to Heroku following the instructions from [week 8](../week8) (navigate to the folder you’re using in the terminal and enter `heroku create` (if you’re using the same GitHub repository from week 8, you can skip the `heroku create` step) and `heroku push`) and use the Heroku link as your “link to hosted assignment” when you submit to the [Homework Form](https://forms.gle/DMcG64NvRdbSjsq57).
- If you’re having trouble with Heroku, just make a note of it in your homework submission and we’ll set aside some time to debug next week.
